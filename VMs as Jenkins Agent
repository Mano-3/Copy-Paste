Using Virtual Machines (VMs) as Jenkins agents is a common practice for scaling Jenkins workloads, especially in environments where different builds require different operating systems or isolated environments. Here’s a general guide on how to set up VMs as Jenkins agents:

### 1. **Set Up the VM**
   - **Create the VM**: Provision a VM on your preferred cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) or use an on-premises hypervisor (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox).
   - **Install the Necessary Software**: Ensure the VM has the required software installed for Jenkins agents, such as:
     - Java (since Jenkins is Java-based)
     - Git (for checking out code repositories)
     - Any other tools or dependencies required by your build jobs.
   - **Set Up SSH Access**: Configure SSH access to the VM. You’ll need to use SSH keys or credentials that Jenkins can use to connect to this VM.

### 2. **Configure the VM as a Jenkins Agent**
   - **Access Jenkins Dashboard**: Log in to your Jenkins instance.
   - **Manage Jenkins**: Navigate to `Manage Jenkins` -> `Manage Nodes and Clouds`.
   - **Add a New Node**:
     1. Click on "New Node".
     2. Give your node a name, select "Permanent Agent", and click "OK".
     3. Configure the node:
        - **Remote Root Directory**: The directory on the agent where Jenkins will perform its work.
        - **Number of Executors**: The number of parallel jobs the agent can handle.
        - **Launch Method**: Choose "Launch agent via SSH".
        - **Host**: The IP address or hostname of the VM.
        - **Credentials**: Select the SSH credentials you configured earlier.
        - **Remote FS Root**: The root directory on the VM where Jenkins will store its files.
     4. Save the configuration.

### 3. **Install Jenkins Agent on the VM**
   - Jenkins can automatically install the agent on the VM when it first connects.
   - Once you save the node configuration, Jenkins will attempt to connect to the VM via SSH and install the necessary agent software.
   - If the connection is successful, you’ll see the agent listed as “online” in the Jenkins dashboard.

### 4. **Test the Setup**
   - Create a simple job in Jenkins and configure it to run on the new VM agent.
   - Execute the job and verify that it runs successfully on the VM.

### 5. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Regularly monitor the VM’s resource usage to ensure it can handle the workloads assigned to it.
   - Update the VM’s software and dependencies as needed.

### 6. **Scaling with Multiple VMs**
   - For larger environments, you might want to set up multiple VMs as agents, possibly with different configurations for different types of jobs.
   - You can also automate the provisioning of VMs using infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform or cloud-init scripts, and configure Jenkins to automatically connect to newly provisioned VMs.

This setup allows Jenkins to offload build tasks to VMs, providing a flexible and scalable CI/CD environment.
